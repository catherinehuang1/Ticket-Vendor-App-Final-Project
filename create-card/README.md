## Create Card Service

Author: Catherine Huang

GitHub ID: catherinehuang1

# Description:

The Create Card service checks if there is a valid user attached to the incoming credit card information, and then creates a credit card object, stores it in its cards collection, and sends the card object out via a POST request. This service has 2 collections in its database, one to store users and the other to store card information.

It does this by listening for a UserConfirmed event that holds a user_id, then adds the user_id to its own valid_user_id collection in its database. If there is a valid user_id, it uses the incoming credit card information from the request body and sends it out to the Confirm Card service via a POST request using the /api/v1/cards endpoint.
